    <owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:about="http://owl.essaid.com/owlcl/owlcl_iri_maps_to">
        <rdfs:comment>Do not use for the time being.

An annotation property that says the subject&apos;s IRI (the left side in the tools code) mappes to the object&apos;s IRI (the right side). The object has to be an IRI, not a string with an IRI value. Mappings can be transitive (but without cycles), i.e.  A mappes to B and B mappes to C, the tools will realize that A is mapped to C but will not check for cycles (which will probably cause an exception at runtime). Also, the inverse mapping is implied and the tools allow the user to apply the mapping in a forward or backward direction.</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:about="http://owl.essaid.com/owlcl/owlcl_isftools-module-source">
        <rdfs:comment>This property is used on a module annotation ontology (not class, etc.) to hold the literal value (i.e. string datatype) of the IRI of a source ontology that is already imported into the annotation ontology. The idea is that the annotation ontology might import several ontologies (to help with editing and exploration) but we only want few of them to be considered sources for the various scripts.</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:about="http://owl.essaid.com/owlcl/owlcl_module_classified_builders">
        <rdfs:comment>This annotation is not fully implemented yet. It holds a list of names for &quot;builders&quot; that should be applied while building the classified version of the module. A builder is an object that is able to contribute axioms to the generated module. For now, the only builder is the one that contributes axioms based on the other annotations. Later, other types might be implemented. This annotation basically traslates to a sequence of actions for building the module. See an example use in the eagle-i modules.</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:about="http://owl.essaid.com/owlcl/owlcl_module_exclude">
        <rdfs:comment>An annotation property that is used to mark entities that should be excluded from a module file. Any children of the excluded class will be moved to be children of the excluded&apos;s parent.</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:about="http://owl.essaid.com/owlcl/owlcl_module_exclude_parent">
        <rdfs:comment>This annotation is meant to prevent pulling the class in (and all its parents) while doing a superclass closure on the already included classes. 

However, if this class is already indicrectly included (by an axiom reference to the class) by some of the included axioms, this annotation will not work since the class is not a &quot;parent&quot; anymore. Rather, it is an &quot;included&quot; class, and the annotation will not work. To fix this situation, at least for now, when this annotation is used on a class, any axiom that is being included in the built module is first checked to see if its signature contains a class annotated with this annotation. The axiom is not included if it references a class annotated with this property.  (this is actually done at the IRI level so it also applies to properties.)

When an axiom is excluded based on its signautre, an INFO level log entry is made (by the tool in the log file) so that this can be easily noticed and corrected as needed.</rdfs:comment>

    <!-- http://owl.essaid.com/owlcl/owlcl_module_include -->

    <owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:about="http://owl.essaid.com/owlcl/owlcl_module_include">
        <rdfs:comment>An annotation property that is used to mark entities that should be included in a module file.

This should cause all the logical axioms that define the IRI of the entity to be included in the module, These axioms are the declaration, and any axioms like sub, equivalent, disjoint, etc. Also, all annotations on the entity will be included. 

Axioms that simply reference the annotated entity (i.e. the axioms that define some other entity, and refer to this annotated entity) will not be included. For example, if A is annotated, and B is sub of A (i.e. B references A in its definition), the axiom &quot;B sub A&quot; will not be included. However, keep in mind that if B is disjoint with A, it also means that A is disjoint with B, and this axiom is part of the definition of A, and it will be included.

In addition to the above axioms, the tool will later include the superclass closure of all included entities, and any entities referenced in the included axioms, unless the &quot;exclude_parent&quot; annotatin is used on one or more paths to the root. See that annotation for more detail.</rdfs:comment>
